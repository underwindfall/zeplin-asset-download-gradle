### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
Before starting directly `zeplin script`, besides that **zeplin token** above, we also need a configuration file to tell plugin
which kind of assets the plugin want to download.
```json
{
  "projectId": "input the zeplin project id",
  "tagName": [],
  "outputDir": "",
  "resourcePrefix": "",
  "deniedList": {
    "screen_ids": []
  },
  "allowList": {
    "screen_ids": [""]
  }
}
```

You can easily invoke it with:

```
./gradlew preMerge
```

If you need to invoke a task inside the included build with:

```
./gradlew -p plugin-build <task-name>
```
